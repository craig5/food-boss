  Format notes:
    - Equipment is not specifically mentioned anywhere.
        It would help to present a list of required equipment at the top.
        Especially for beginners.

    - The id attr in the recipe tag cannot be guaranteed to be unique.
        One idea is to scope the recipe. Eg. have a domain name as a recipe attr.

    - Version may be better as an attr of the recipe, not a tag in the metdadata section.

    A bunch of comments about when it was made on 1 March, 2013 at 1pm *UTC*.
    UTC because I REALLY do not want to deal with time zones or daylight savings time.
    Can add one of these notes every time it is made.
